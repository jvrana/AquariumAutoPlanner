## Forward Planning Algorithm

Adaptive (?) Directed Steiner Tree with Groups:

## Development Roadmap

### v0.1 (Complete)
First draft of Terrarium. 

* Automated forward planning algorithm.
* JSON design input

### v0.2 (In Progress)
Refactoring.

* HTTP requests and algorithm are separated. Algorithms use JSON-like objects exclusively.
* Faster forward planning algorithm
* Improved API

### v0.3
* multi-goal optimization
* OperationTypes as goals

### v0.4
* Predict data association inputs and outputs
* Data requests as goals.
* incorporate time and monetary cost in forward planning algorithm

### v0.5-0.9
* Automated 'runner' for running code on Aquarium plans
* Rule-book error correction

### v1.0
* simple web UI
* simple CLI

### v2.0
* standardized tools for statistics and ML for Aquarium workflows, plans, inventory (??)
* generate figures and reports

### v3.0
Publication version
* Integration of Densmore lab's *Crucible* for bootstrapping a new laboratory.
* Integration with CAD tools as plugins (DASi, j5, Benchling, RavenCAD?)
* fancier UI
